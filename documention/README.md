## 1. About the Project

### 1.1 Project Description

**Hit Me Up** is a fictional, dark-humored web application for an underground hitman-for-hire network. The app allows users to create an account, log in securely, and browse or book hitmen services or purchase weapons. Styled with an edgy, underground aesthetic, it balances humor, creativity, and full-stack functionality.

This project was created to demonstrate advanced web development skills, specifically full-stack architecture, user authentication, dynamic routing, and professional UI/UX design.

**Who it's for:** Developers, students, or instructors exploring secure login systems, modern front-end architecture, and API integration.

**Why it exists:** As part of an educational assignment, this app satirically demonstrates how full-stack apps work while reinforcing professional development workflows.

**API:**

   Our custom API was developed with Express.js and Mongoose, allowing us to define models, routes, and controller logic that handled data related to users, hitmen, and weapons.

  API supported full CRUD operations, enabling secure and dynamic interaction between the frontend and the database through RESTful endpoints.

   Password security was ensured using bcrypt, following best practices in real-world development environments.

   This shift reinforced our understanding of building secure, scalable, and production-ready APIs tailored to the needs of the application.

## 3. Features and Usage

-  **User Authentication**: We implemented a secure sign-up and login system using express sessions and bcrypt for hashing user passwords. This ensures that only authenticated users can access routes such as the cart, wishlist, and administrator functions
-  **Product Viewing**: Users can browse products and hitman services stored on our mongodb database
-  **Dark-Themed UI**: The design embraces a dark, edgy visual identity to match the satirical, underground concept of the project. The styling uses a mix of custom CSS, React-Bootstrap, minimal animations to maintain usability while establishing a strong brand personality. The layout is responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
-  **Modular Architecture**: The frontend follows a component-based architecture to follow best practices in programming modular systems. This improves readability, scalability, and maintainability. The structure also allows for quick updates or the addition of new features with minimal disruption to existing code.
-  **React Router**: Seamless route management powered by react-router
- **Administrative Functionality**: The web application includes admin limited functionality such as adding, deleting, and reviewing products.
